# Defines the default configuration for the CUI-Portal
portal:
  # View specific Configuration
  view:
    # Usually all our applications need authentication. This parameter defines the views 
    # or partial trees that do not need any authentication
    # in order to be displayed, as comma separated list.
    # Caution: The views are relative to the root, usually starting with /faces. 
    # The distinct values are to be checked using String#startsWith().
    # The default for the portal is '/faces/guest/'. 
    # In order to match all views you can use '/'.
    non_secured: /faces/guest/
    # Defines the views that are transient, therefore not part of the state saving. 
    # Caution: The views are relative to the root, usually starting with /faces. 
    # The distinct values are to be checked using String#startsWith(). 
    # The default for the portal is '/faces/guest/'. 
    # In order to match all views you can use '/'. 
    transient: /faces/guest/
    # Defines the views that are being suppressed: The portal provides many artifacts 
    # that can be overridden by concrete modules. 
    # This can be services or beans, usually to be overridden using the CDI way. 
    # In addition, there are templates that can be overridden by our template mechanisms.
    # But what about overriding pages that are delivered from the portal, 
    # e.g. faces/guest/login.jsf? 
    # If a concrete application has its own pages like in pep 
    # using /faces/pep-ui/guest/login.jsf for login. 
    # Due to the deployment mechanics of the portal faces/guest/login.jsf will still be 
    # accessible. 
    # In order to deal with this issue the portal view suppression mechanics may be used.
    # Caution: The views are relative to the root, usually starting with /faces. 
    # The distinct values are to be checked using String#startsWith(). 
    # The default for the portal is '', saying no view is to be suppressed.
    suppressed: ""
    # Enables the view part cache (e.g. for the navigation menu).
    cache.enabled: true
    # Defines the views that are only accessible if the user has a specific role.

  # Resource Configuration
  resource:
    # A comma separated list of libraries that should be handled by the CuiResourceHandler. 
    # Handled by the resource handler means selecting the .min-version of the resource 
    # if available and adding a cache-buster to the resource request.

    handled_libraries: de.cuioss.fonts,de.cuioss.portal.css,de.cuioss.javascript,thirdparty.js,vendor

    # A comma separated list of suffixes that should be handled by the CuiResourceHandler.
    # Handled by the resource handler means selecting the .min-version of the resource is 
    # available and adding a cache-buster to the resource request. 
    # The default value for the Portal is: "eot,ttf,svg,js,css,woff" 
    handled_suffixes: eot,ttf,svg,js,css,woff

    # The String used for the cache buster for the resources under the control. 
    # The default value for the Portal is: The corresponding cui version, e.g. "7.3"
    version: ${project.version}

    # To allow caching of specific resources it allows to specify how long (in minutes) the

  # Theme Configuration

  # History Configuration
  history:

    # lower-cased as well 
    # The default for the portal is 'samlresponse,jsessionid,jfwid'
